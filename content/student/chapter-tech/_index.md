#### Popular Javascript web frameworks

Major players; require Node.js on the server

1. Angular - a full framework, supported by Google
1. React - only a library. Invented by Facebook, but open source now
1. Vue.JS - modeled by original Angular, independent and open source

{{% note %}}
- Angular controlled by Google and may change
- React needs other framework components
- Vue is youngest and less docs available

#### Non-JS web frameworks

- Python
  - Django - Very extensive, open-source framework
  - Flask - Minimal, light, open-source framework
- C#
  - .Net Core - Controlled by Microsoft, but platform independent
- Ruby on Rails - Open-source Ruby web framework, lost some steam recently
- PHP (legacy) – but good with new frameworks
  - Laravel - easy, video tutorials
  - Yii - performant, but steep learning curve
- Java
  - Java Server Faces (JSF) - Legacy
  - Java Spring - similar to .Net, controlled by Oracle

{{% note %}}
- Django comes with admin section.
- .Net Core: Heavily object-oriented, optional Angular for front-end
