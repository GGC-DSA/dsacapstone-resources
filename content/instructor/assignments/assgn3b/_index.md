**Client meeting and Requirements**

Contact your client(s) and have a meeting with him/her/them this week:

1. Set up a meeting with the clients. Ask them to give you 2-3 times, or simply offer several options yourself to speed up the process. CC me on your email to your client.

2. Post files in your team repo reflecting the log of the client meeting and the requirements document  (1-2 pages) explained below. Make a folder /doc in your repo and put these files within this folder.

**Requirements report:**

* Make a folder called docs_Fall2020/ in your repo. This will be the folder where you will be submitting your project documents throughout the semester.

* Think of each person's skills and what you'd like to learn to pick a platform and framework to learn and use this semester.

* Make a new list of requirements.

 
**Requirement list should include:**

* priority

* justification

* separation of functional, non-functional, and domain requirements
