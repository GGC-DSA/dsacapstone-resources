### Manifesto for Agile Software Development 


**"We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.  Through this work we have come to value:**

* <span style="color:blue"> Individuals and interactions </span> over processes and tools 
* Working software over comprehensive documentation 
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation 
* Responding to change over following a plan 

**That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.”**


[Kent Beck et al] (http://agilemanifesto.org/)
