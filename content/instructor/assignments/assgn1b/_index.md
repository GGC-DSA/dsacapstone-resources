**Posting for Students**:

**Set up your accounts**

This semester we will use several tools for communicating and version control that are commonly used in the industry. As software developers, you need to get familiarized with these tools.

Post a followup below with your accounts on:

* Discord

* Github

* Jira (later)

Links for these can be found here (post).

We will be using [Github](https://github.com/) organization "GGC-SD". Post your Github account here so we can add you to it. Use the "followup discussions" so we know who you are. 

We are using Discord for fast communication. Post your Discord nickname/ID so I can add you to our server.
