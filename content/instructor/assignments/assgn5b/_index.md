## Assgn 5b (team): Jira - Add user stories to team progress tracker

**Instructor Instructions**: 
* Students submit directly on Jira server.
* Suggested time: 7 days

**Posting for Students**:

**Each team member** is responsible for:

* having registered into the progress tracker selected for your team,
* contribute to creating epics/user stories/tasks (created by the user),
* having a user story/task/chore assigned, and
* keeping track of the times s/he spent on studying/preparing/working on tasks.
 
**Epics/User stories** (use "Issues" in JIRA) must have:

* Title/Summary: answers to who, what, why questions. Example: "As a user, I need to do something because of some reason"
* Story points/difficulty/estimate: A previously agreed-upon numbering grade that indicates difficulty. 
* Priority (ordering/drag-drop is fine)
* Epics are optional; use them sparingly.
 
**User story subtasks** must have:

* Informative and detailed title and proper system requirement details
* Estimated hours that you think it's going to take
* Continuous tracking of your hours as you work on it
* Been assigned to a person
 
**Make sure that user stories are substantial.** Some tasks can be added as chores instead of user stories.** User stories must be from the perspective of the user, and NOT from the perspective of the developer.** Eg., "adding color/button for login to interface" is not a user story; it can be added as a subtask of a user story or as a chore.
