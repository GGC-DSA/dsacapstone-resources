<h2 id="wiki_deliverables">Deliverables</h2>
<p>In the final phase of this semester, you will have these main deliverables:</p>
<ol>
<li>App Factory Demos to outside of class people (usually during a symposium on campus/online in the last week of semester)</li>
<li>Final team technical presentation in class (during last week of classes)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Demo deliverables (due TBA):</h2>
<p>Submit these on the forum post as a reply:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Project flyer: description of functionality with screenshots; include a single letter-size (11"x8.5") page flyer in PNG format that has a screenshot or artwork and message to be the flash card for your product (see examples from previous semesters at <a href="https://soft-eng-practicum.github.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" target="_blank">https://soft-eng-practicum.github.io/</a> )</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intellectual property agreement signed by all team members and client (don't post on repo, put it on Reddit)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>App Factory Demo user testing survey draft - should be couple of questions <strong>specific</strong> to your project because I will give a second survey with generic questions (see <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSda5RLNFs35RlLpMeA5EtTBPzkWxi072yEbjaEUNXqXSeRPig/viewform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">example 1</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSePguJl3fO66mWJoYL73MtCoQsw16Pa4t307IR4DIDIciePsA/viewform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">example 2</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>Provide a short screencast demoing your product live (prefer a screen recorder with voiceover rather than a hand-held camera). This will be a public video, don't show private information that you don't want to share. Upload it to Youtube and provide a link. (see examples from previous semesters at <a href="https://soft-eng-practicum.github.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" target="_blank">https://soft-eng-practicum.github.io/</a> )</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="wiki_final_submission_deadline_.28midnight.2C_wed_may_1st.29">Final technical presentation (due TBA) and report submission (due TBA)</h2>
<p>Post these on the forum:</p>
<ul>
<li>In-class presentation file. In your presentation file, make sure to include links for the live product/download/etc if they apply. Make sure they are shareable! See below to see what goes into the presentation. If you don't want to post your presentation publicly, you can password-protect it. But don't forget to post that password.</li>
<li>Report, including signed agreement/license, screencast video (upload to Youtube and provide link), user testing results from App Factory. Report can be uploaded to your repo.</li>
</ul>
<p>Emails that need to be sent out:</p>
<ul>
<li>All project materials including final deployment to client - send an email to client and copy me that includes:
<ul>
<li>Your report</li>
<li>Instructions for your client to access the product and documentation</li>
<li>Signed agreement</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Send me a separate email and tell me what your client and team can agree to make your Github repo public. It's beneficial for you to convert to public because it will show up in your public Github profile that the recruiters can see. Before making it public, make sure no secret API keys or passwords are kept in your files. If any of them are exposed, it's not sufficient to delete them as they will stay in the history. The keys and passwords need to be changed. Alternatively, you can decide to take over ownership into your own account. If you don't respond, I may delete your private repo from my Github organization after a while.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final team technical class presentations contents</h3>

<li>Account of how much difficulty, how many user stories, and how many hours of work were done in past iterations.</li>
<li>What's the team's and members' individual velocity? What was the initial difficulty estimates and what did they turn out to be at the end? Explain how they ended up like that.</li>
<li>Based on current data, how do you plan to improve accuracy of your estimation in the future iterations? (change difficulties or over/under estimate hours for different members/technologies/tasks)</li>
<li>Show an iteration burndown chart</li>
<li>Any other relevant information</li>
