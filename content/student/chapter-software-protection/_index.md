#### Copyright Law

Copyright is a form of IP protection that 
gives its owner the right to:
1. reproduce the copyrighted work
2. prepare derivative works based upon the work
3. distribute copies of the work to the public
4. perform the copyrighted work publicly 
5. display the copyrighted work publicly

- Copyright protects the expression of an 
idea, but not the idea itself

#### “Look and Feel” of Software

- Most courts that have examined this issue have sided with the
copyright protection of the graphical user interface

{{% fragment %}}

- **Rationale:** Copyright protection extends not only to the literal
elements of a program, i.e., its source and object codes, but also to
its protected "nonliteral" elements, such as the program architecture,
structure, sequence, organization and computer-user interface

> If non-literal element A in Software AA is **substantially similar** to
the non-literal element B in Software BB, then copyright infringement

#### Non-Literal Elements of Software

- GUI, structure of the code, etc. 
- There are various tests for determining what non-literal elements of
  software are protected, but the most influential test is the
  _abstraction-filtration-comparison_ test.
