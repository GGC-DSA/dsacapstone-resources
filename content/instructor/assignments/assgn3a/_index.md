Please read the project description (we will discuss them briefly in class) and decide on which project you would like to work on. Also, select your own team and convince your team to work on the project (we will work on this in class). Then, decide on the team name and post it below, along with the names of the team members and the project name. Chose a meaningful fun team name; it will be your Github project name. We will use this for naming the Discord channel and Github team code repo. Give exact spelling. 

Rule: Teams must be at least 3 and up to 4 people. Exception; to be a 5-person team, you really need to justify why you need so many people. That doesn't mean "oh this project is so big!", you have to clearly separate the work into different members. While teams of 2 will be allowed under some circumstances, I highly suggest to avoid them, since projects have many tasks and you will get easily overwhelmed by the amount of work.

Post under the format:

Team name:

Member 1:

Member 2:

Member 3:

Member 4:
