#### What is the difference between Github and Gist?

The main differences between github and gists are in terms of 

* type of project

* number of features: 
Github is designed many features and flexibility in mind, which is a good fit for both small and very big projects, while Gists are only a good fit for very small projects. 


* user interface:
Gists do support multi-files, but the interface is very simple, and they're limited in features, so they don't even have a file browser, nor issues, pull requests or wiki, unlike Github.
