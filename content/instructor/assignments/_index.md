This section includes all the small assignments for the course.

Assignments are marked as **individual** or **team** to clarify for students what type of submission is expected.

Each assignment includes two parts:

1. **Instructor Instructions**: 
Includes suggestions for setting up the particular assignment (like, time-wise, platform,etc).

2. **Posting for Students**:
The text can posted to students.

Some assignments are split into several mini-assignments such that each mini-assignment can be assigned at its own deadline. However, in the grade book all parts are summed up into one assignment, for example 'grade of Assgn 1a' +  'grade of Assgn 1b' + 'grade of Assgn 1c' = 'grade of Assgn 1'
