## What is "AGILITY"?

{{% fragment %}} <p align='left'>Effective (rapid and adaptive) response to change </p> {{% /fragment %}}

{{% fragment %}} <p align='left'> Effective (rapid and adaptive) communication among all stakeholders </p> {{% /fragment %}}

{{% fragment %}} <p align='left'> The CLIENT is part of the TEAM </p> {{% /fragment %}}

{{% fragment %}} <p align='left'> The TEAM is in control of the work performed </p> {{% /fragment %}}

{{% fragment %}} 
<em> resulting in </em>

**rapid, incremental delivery of software**

### Agile Process 

{{% fragment %}} <p align='left'> * **User Scenarios** are descriptions of what is required (requirements) and drive the entire production process </p> {{% /fragment %}}

{{% fragment %}} <p align='left'> * Plans are short-lived and can change frequently </p> {{% /fragment %}}

{{% fragment %}} <p align='left'> * Software is developed **iteratively** and is delivered after each iteration </p> {{% /fragment %}}

{{% fragment %}} <p align='left'> * **Adapts** as changes occur </p> {{% /fragment %}}

### Agile is based on

{{% fragment %}} **4 values** and {{% /fragment %}}

{{% fragment %}} **12 principles** {{% /fragment %}}


---

### Agile Values

{{% fragment %}}<p align='left'> 1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools </p>{{% /fragment %}}

{{% fragment %}}<p align='left'> 2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation </p>{{% /fragment %}} 

{{% fragment %}}<p align='left'> 3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation </p>{{% /fragment %}} 

{{% fragment %}}<p align='left'> 4. **Responding to change** over following a plan </p>{{% /fragment %}}

### Agile Principles

{{% fragment %}} 1. **Satisfy the Customer** 

Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
{{% /fragment %}}

{{% fragment %}} 2. **Welcome Change** 

Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage. 
{{% /fragment %}} 

{{% fragment %}} 3. **Deliver Solutions Frequently** 

Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

### Agile Principles

{{% fragment %}} 4. **Work Together** 

Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project (one team).
{{% /fragment %}}

{{% fragment %}} 5. **Empower & Trust** 

Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. 
{{% /fragment %}}

{{% fragment %}} 6. **Face to Face Conversations** 

The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face–to–face conversation.

### Agile Principles

{{% fragment %}} 7. **Working Solutions** 

Working software solutions are the primary measure of progress. 
{{% /fragment %}} 

{{% fragment %}} 8. **Sustainable Pace** 

Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.  
{{% /fragment %}}

{{% fragment %}} 9. **Technical Excellence** 

Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility (quality). 
{{% /fragment %}}

### Agile Principles

{{% fragment %}} 10. **Simplicity is Essential** 

Simplicity – the art of maximizing the amount of work not done – is essential.
{{% /fragment %}} 

{{% fragment %}} 11. **Self-organizing Teams** 

The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self–organizing teams. 
{{% /fragment %}} 

{{% fragment %}} 12. **Reflect & Adjust** 

At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

### How to do Agile?

**The process molds to the needs of the people and team**, not the other way around

There are many Agile process models proposed by various groups...

---

### Agile Modeling 

{{% fragment %}} Originally proposed by Scott Ambler {{% /fragment %}} 

{{% fragment %}} Suggests a set of agile modeling principles:

* Model with a purpose
* Use multiple models
* Travel light – build only what has value
* Content is more important than representation
* Know the models and the tools you use to create them
* Adapt locally to the needs of the agile team

### Extreme Programming (XP)

Originally proposed by Kent Beck, and used in industry often in a hybrid format

{{< figure src="/softdev2-resources/images/extremeprogramming.png" width=500 >}}

---

### Extreme Programming (XP)

**Planning**

* Begins with the creation of **user stories**
* Agile team assesses each story and assigns a **cost**
* Stories are grouped to for a **deliverable increment**
* A **commitment** is made on delivery date
* After the first increment **project velocity** is used to help define subsequent delivery dates for other increments

---

### Extreme Programming (XP)

**Design**

* Follows the **KIS principle** (KIS = keep it simple)
* Encourage the use of **CRC cards**
* For difficult design problems, suggests the creation of **spike solutions** —a design prototype
* Encourages **refactoring** —an iterative refinement of the internal program design

---

### Extreme Programming (XP)

**Coding**

* Recommends the **construction of a unit test** for a story **before coding** commences
* Encourages **pair programming**


{{% fragment %}}**Testing**

* All **unit tests are executed daily**
* **Acceptance tests** are defined by the customer and executed to assess customer visible functionality
