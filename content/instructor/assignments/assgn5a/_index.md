# Practice assignment for Agile progress tracking in JIRA 

This is a practice assignment, **do not put your actual project user stories here**. We will create mock versions of sprints, epics, user stories, and subtasks.

Even though JIRA is not your progress tracking tool of your choice this semester, we will use it to practice Agile concepts. Look into the Atlassian documentation for JIRA [here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira064/jira-documentation-720411693.html) to get started or if you get stuck in any of the following steps.

## Steps
1. Look in your GGC email for an invitation from me into your JIRA account.
2. Log into JIRA using the link on the course page.
3. Under the *Projects* menu, click *View all projects* and find project title given in the assignment post. Select the Backlog from the left side menu - it is the default screen when you open a project.
4. If noone in your team has done it yet, create a new _Epic_ **name** "team name/project name" with the **summary** "a team (team name) of students can develop (project name)", where you replace "team name" and "project name" with the respective names from your currently assigned team project. To create the Epic, click on the _Create_ button on top of the screen and select the appropriate options.
5. Under your team Epic, create one User Story for yourself. In the Epic detail view, click on the "+" sign on the _Issues_ section. Alternatively, use can still use the _Create_ button, but make sure you select the Epic to link at the bottom of the form. The story should explain your role in the project, such as "Developer (name) will (your role in project) such that (reason for selecting role)". **Assign** this story to yourself. 
6. Drag your personal story from the backlog list into the current Sprint. Add a difficulty estimate to it. 
7. Under your personal Story, create 3 subtasks about: taking this course, selecting your team, and completing the project. 

    i. Before you change anything, select _Active sprints_ from the left side bar. Find your story and tasks and take a screenshot of it, and post it as a "before" attachment in your story.
    
    ii. Click on each Task to go to its detail screen. Under the menu _More_, select _Log Work_ and assign some random amount of time that you spent for each task.
    
    iii. Assign each task to a different member of your team.
    
    iv. Mark each of three tasks' progress differently, as _TODO_, _In progress_, and _Done_ in their detail screen. Alternatively, in the _Active sprints_ screen, you can drag stories and tasks across the three columns that correspond to their status.
    
    v. Put a comment under at least one of _someone else's_ user stories in your epic. Then put a comment under _your_ story telling me under whom did you comment.

8. Mark your story as _In Progress_.
9. Take another screenshot once you're done and post it as an "after" attachment in your story.
10. Create a new sub-task in your story titled "Grade me!" and assign it to your instructor to finish the assignment.

Post questions/problems/suggestions for improvement below.

There's a dark theme for JIRA if you prefer, by following these instructions:

This is an extension for Chrome users, didn't look to see if it works on Firefox or other browsers. For those of you who find the JIRA interface to be an eyesore and prefer a darker scheme, here's a website where you are able to change the look of it:  https://userstyles.org/

After clicking that link, type JIRA into the search bar. I recommend Jira Dark Flat, it seems to work the best. Click the download button and it should install the extension automatically and the theme.  Once the extension is installed, click the extension icon and click on the 3 dot menu and go to manage all styles.  Click on the edit button of the theme.  At the bottom, you should see the "applies to" where you have to specify the site. Add one where it will be URL's starting with: and include http://itec-gunay.duckdns.org
