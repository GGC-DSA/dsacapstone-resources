## Assgn 4a (individual): Project roles

**Instructor Instructions**: 
* This assignment should be posted on the class platform to allow all students to see each other entries. This will help them work with their teammates.
* Suggested time: 3-5 days

**Posting for Students**:

**Project Roles:**

**Programmer** 

Set 1:

* Code architecture/lead programmer - in charge of the framework, components, coding style, and programming. It doesn't mean the only programmer! Everyone must program, lead programmer decides on the overall design and coding standards.
* UI/UX design: User Interface and User eXperience. Make mock UI designs and user-friendly navigation. Implements and tests interface.
* Data modeler: Implements Database, data files, server-client structure, and data structures.

Set 2:

* Team manager: Sprint planning, and time accounting for the team. 
* Client liaison: Communications, demos, and negotiations with the client, what was done and planned to handle the client's requirements (role can be combined with the manager)
* Documentation lead: Setup documentation conventions for code and project, then delegate work onto teammates. Manage presentations, reports, and licensing documentation. Every one must add documentation!
* Testing lead: Setup testing framework and conventions. Use continuous integration to test at each commit/push. Everyone must do their own testing!

**In addition to the programmer role, each team member has 2 roles within the team, one from Set 1 and one from Set 2.** These are roles you can pick. Later in the semester, you would need to give a presentation on your primary role, or it could include a mix of two roles. If multiple team members are working on the same role, the grade will get divided among them. You must have a primary role to get full points.

Note that all roles are mandatory and each person in the team may need more than one role in order to get full points on the project.

**Assignment requirements:**

* Each person must pick one or more roles from the list above.
* Each team must have all of the roles distributed among its members. Make sure you talk with your team and coordinate the roles before posting.
* Each person must post his/her roles as a follow up below.

Example role posting:
Chris Chris - Team ABC
* 1st Role: Code Architecture/Lead Programmer 60%
* 2nd Role: Team Manager 40%
