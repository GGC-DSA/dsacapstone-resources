# Intermediate Agile Software Development Textbook Resources

This textbook is rendered using a static site generator
(or [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/)) system
called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). It is primarily built by combining
two Hugo
themes, [Techdoc](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-techdoc/)
and [reveal-hugo](https://themes.gohugo.io/reveal-hugo/). Techdoc
provides the documentation-style browsing of book chapters and
reveal-hugo provides the capability of online accessible chapter
presentations using the [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) technology.

The generated site can then be hosted on any static host (such
as [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)). This repository is rendered
and hosted on Github Pages and it is automatically generated at each
push by using [Github's Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) feature.
