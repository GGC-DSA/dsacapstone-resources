**Instructor Instructions**: 
* This assignment should be posted on the class platform to allow all students to see each other entries. This will help them work with their teammates..

**Posting for Students**:

**Project Roles:**

### Just to be clear! Everyone in the team MUST do code implementation in order to pass this class.

In addition to the programmer role, each team member has 2 roles within the team. These are roles you can pick. Later in the semester, you would need to give a presentation on your primary role, or it could include a mix of two roles. If multiple team members are working on the same role, the grade will get divided among them. You must have a primary role to get full points.

* Code architecture/lead programmer: framework, components, coding style. Doesn't mean the only programmer! Everyone must program, lead programmer decides on the overall design and coding standards.
* UI/UX design: User Interface and User eXperience. Make mock UI designs and user-friendly navigation.
* Data modeler: Database, data files, server-client structure, data structures.
* Team manager: Sprint planning, and time accounting for the team. 
* Client liaison: Communications, demos, and negotiations with client, what was done and planned to handle client's requirements (role can be combined with manager)
* Documentation lead: Setup documentation conventions for code and project, then delegate work onto teammates. Manage presentations, reports, and licensing documentation. Everyone must add documentation!
* Testing lead: Setup testing framework and conventions. Use continuous integration to test at each commit/push. Everyone must do their own testing!
 
Note that all roles are mandatory and each person in the team may need more than one role.

**Assignment requirements:**

* Each person must pick one or more roles from the list above.
* Each team must have all of the roles distributed among its members.
* Access your team repo and edit the README.md file
* Follow the [generic Markdown language help](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) or [GIthub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) markdown flavors

* Format your README.md file to have the following information:
  1. Team/project names
  2. Repo location URL
  3. Progress tracking tool and URL
  4. If there is another communication tool (e.g., Slack channel, WhatsApp, GroupMe)
