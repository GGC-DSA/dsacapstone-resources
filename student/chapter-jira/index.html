<p>What is Project Management?</p>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  <strong>Project management</strong> is the process of matching a project&rsquo;s goals, tasks, and resources to accomplish a goal considering also constrains like limited time, money, and resources (people and tools) with which to accomplish the goal.
</span>

<h3 id="project-step-1-defining-the-goals-of-the-project">Project Step 1: Defining the goals of the project</h3>
<ul>
<li>entire team must participate</li>
<li>each team member must understand these goals</li>
<li>step ends with a list of goals and a statement of success</li>
</ul>
<p>Defining success is necessary to make sure there is no ambiguity as to whether the goal has been accomplished or not. It also prevents teams from performing unnecessary
iteration and improvement on a goal which has been sufficiently accomplished.</p>
</section><section>
<h3 id="project-step-2-define-project-tasksactivities">Project Step 2: Define project tasks/activities</h3>
<p>Each goal or sub-set of goals should be matched to the tasks required to accomplish them. Team should agree on the tasks that will define the success of each goal.</p>

<h3 id="project-step-3-determine-and-verify-resource-requirements">Project Step 3: Determine and verify resource requirements</h3>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  <strong>The most important here is to be realistic</strong>, meaning to determine what resources you need (like people, time, money, space, computers, software, etc.) to get the job done correctly, on time, and on budget.
</span>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  <ul>
<li>Most common mistake is to underestimate the amount and type of resources required, which leads to projects that run over budget and fall behind schedule.</li>
</ul>
<p>DO NOT:
• Squeeze a project into a shorter time frame to please your boss
• Cut corners to minimize resource requirements
• Plan on a best-case basis, i.e. &ldquo;If everything goes correctly, we will finish on time.&rdquo;</p>

</span>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  <ul>
<li>A good idea is to build in a safety margin of 20% in terms of time and budget, which will give additional time to deal with unexpected occurrences.</li>
</ul>

</span>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  <ul>
<li>Once the requirements have been set, it is important to make sure that the team has access to them to minimize risk.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="project-step-4-identify-risks-and-develop-backup-plans">Project Step 4: Identify risks and develop backup plans</h3>
<p>

<span class='fragment '
  >
  Projects always involve an <strong>amount of uncertainty (risk)</strong> that may lead to problems and surprises during the project development.
</span>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  As a professional you will be required to help get the job done. You must learn how to deal with surprises and adversity, and not be pushed around by them.
</span></p>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  Risk management is important as it helps the team accomplish the project with as little trouble as possible, and could be very complex.
</span>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  <p>One simple idea is to identify the risks for each task and build a backup plan to help keep you on schedule.</p>

<p>During this stage, the project manager is responsible for coordinating, though group members should communicate among themselves as required.</p>
<p>Each team member should document their activities during this step.</p>

<h3 id="project-step-7-finish-the-project-and-assessing-performance">Project Step 7: Finish the project and assessing performance</h3>
<p>After the goals have been achieved, it is good practice to evaluate the performance of the project team. We call this <strong>retrospective session</strong>.</p>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  To review the team&rsquo;s performance we will use <strong>Burndown</strong> (<a href="../chapter-agiledevelopment/chapter-scrum/#/11">see</a>) and <strong>Velocity</strong> charts.
</span>
<p>

<span class='fragment '
  >
  Velocity is the amount of work a team can handle during a set period of time (sprint).
</span>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  The velocity chart is a visual representation of the project’s progress.
</span></p>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  <p>Managers use velocity to measure the rate at which an Agile development team delivers value to a business.</p>

  <ul>
<li>We are using AGILE during the semester, with the project being split int 3 main phases (<a href="../chapter-project-design/">see</a> for details on each phase). Thus, Steps 1-7 need to be implemented for each of these phases.</li>
</ul>

</span>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  <ul>
<li>To help the project management process and the team build up a schedule and keep track of the tasks, we will be using a project management tool called <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a></li>
